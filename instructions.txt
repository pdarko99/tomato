-- this project is an ecommerce frontend project

-- the backend exits on this path "/Users/princedarko/Desktop/main/tickets/java/ecommerce"

-- the backend is the true status

-- please take time to go through the backend their endpoints and everthing

-- there's a functionality.md file which even gives a summary

-- now i want you to modify the ui to match the endpoints


-- dont change the ui per say, i love the current design

-- for instance the dashboard let it match the response from the /api/admin/dashboard

-- so try and make the backend response match the ui that's what i mean
